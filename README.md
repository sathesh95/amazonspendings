# amazonspendings
This python code uses selenium and beautifulsoup to scrape through all your purchase history and find out how much money you have spent on amazon for a particular year.Since Amazon India doesn't give its customers a tool to calculate total annual spending So I thought this code might help the customers calculate their annual spends.

This code was written using Jupyter Notebook and hence it is in the .ipynb format.

Once the code is completely run the purchase data is stored as a excel file in the directory of your choice.The data is not clean yet.So don't worry if your cells show blank value.Just click on them and you will see the  values.

You now have all the purchases you have made for the year in terms of money in one single Excel column.

Clean the data using find and replace to delete the spaces/special characters(Rs,/) before using the SUM function to calculate the total money spent.This code does the work of scraping all your purchase data so that you can calculate your total spending using a couple minutes of excel work.

The next version might very well calculate your entire spendings and  through code execution itself.But for now this is a workaround to avoid data cleaning in the code.Suggestions and contributions are welcome.

Hope you found this useful,
